# Hello World!

So, this is the 1st official blog post for **Star Strike**. I honestly just wanna set the starting point a bit, between versions 0.0.1 and 0.0.2.


## Objectives:

Here i will lay down the different objectives and deadlines of the game, keep in mind that these are all just an estimation, and may change in the future.

### Release of 0.0.2

Version 0.0.2 is the version where i intend the game to actually have some appeal to play, so the ranked system will be integrated, as well as just general polish of it. The projected release for it is in **mid-end July 2023**.

### Release of the Star Strike beta.

This is projected to happen on the **end of summer**, and in this beta the online mode should be fully finished, with all the ships, maps, currencies, systems, etc... 

So, this has been the 1st Star Strike blog post, I hope I have new and exciting stuff to tell you as soon as possible, but for now, goodbye.

Here is a completely random function from Star Strike (there will be one on every post)
```csharp
public  virtual  void  InitWeapon()
{
	GameObject  wepList  =  GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("wepList");
	InstantiatedWeaponUI  =  Instantiate(WeaponUI, wepList.transform);
	Ship  =  gameObject.GetComponent<ScapeshipV2>();
	shipRB  =  gameObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
	bool  hasFiringpoint  =  false;
	CanFire  =  true;
	if (wepClass  ==  WeaponClass.Small)
	{
		//Debug.Log("Searching for FP");
		SmallFP[] smallFPs  =  gameObject.GetComponentsInChildren<SmallFP>();
		foreach (SmallFP  FP  in  smallFPs)
    }
	if (hasFiringpoint) return;
	if (!FP.isTaken)
	{
		firingPoint  =  FP.transform;
		if (firingSound  !=  null)
		{
			weaponSound  =  FP.gameObject.GetComponentInChildren<AudioSource>();
			weaponSound.clip  =  firingSound;
		}
		if (weaponVisualsPrefab  !=  null)
		{
			Instantiate(weaponVisualsPrefab, FP.transform);
		}
		FP.isTaken  =  true;
		hasFiringpoint  =  true;
	}
}
```
