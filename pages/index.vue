				</p>
				<p class="text-lg font-semibold">
					Star Strike is an upcoming (actively in-development) spaceship combat game. It aims to be a competitive experience where skill differientiates the good pilots from the bad ones, and where there is no grind/engineering (I have gone through the pain too) required. Depending on the success of the online multiplayer mode, there will also be a story mode released at a later date.

					Pricing
				</p>
				<p class="text-lg font-semibold">
					Star Strike is, and will ever be free forever with no ADS! Even though I will be gaining no money at all for this (donations are accepted, see footer), I think it is the best choice for both me and the community, since that makes the game accesible to everyone that wants to play it!
